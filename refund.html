<h1>Refund Policy</h1>

<p>
As I do not sell physical or digital products and do not process customer payments,
refunds are generally not applicable.
</p>

<p>
If a payment has been made in error related to my development activities or platform payouts,
please contact me so the situation can be reviewed and resolved promptly.
